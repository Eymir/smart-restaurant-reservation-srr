# project overview: #
**Smart Restaurant Reservation (SRR) is an online reservation (system/application) that offers premier online service which connects restaurants with new and existing customers. With Smart Restaurant Reservation (SRR), customers can check, online, the availability of tables in a restaurant and make a reservation at a specified time for a specified number of people. They also can update their reservations in advance (at least 45 minutes before the specified time).  This service will provide a fast and  efficient way to find available tables in restaurants. Since Smart Restaurant Reservation (SRR) is an online service, customers can make reservations any time, regardless of the hour. On the other hand, restaurants will be able to manage parties  easily, and they will also be able to have some control over the availability and number of reservations allowed. However, restaurants should have an online website in order to get these advantages.**
